      <h2>About ProgLang</h2>
      <p>
        This website was made as a way for both experienced and inexperienced
        programmers to learn, support one another and entertain each other.
        Every programming language has a quick, wikipedia-like article explaining
        a bit about the history of the language, with a short tutorial at the end.
        Each language also has a little forum where posts can be made. These posts
        are only limited to the language they are about. All posts are allowed
        from asking for help with your code to showing off your personal projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Trust-Score</h2>
      <p>
        Every user is given a rating from 1 to 10 on how trustworthy we find them.
        This is based on many factors like how long they have been a member, how
        popular their posts are and how helpful their articles/article edits are.
        To begin with, every user's Trust-Score is 5. the easiest way to raise
        your TS is by making a post on the forum. Depending on how popular your
        post is, you could gain up to 4 TS points.
