<h2>Rules:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Be nice. Treat other users the way you would expect to be treated.
        You must afford every user you interact with, with the same respect
        you would wish to be given.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Do not promote or post any sexist, racist, homophobic,
        pornographic or otherwise potentially offensive content.
        None of this will be tolerated on any part of the website.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Do not discuss world politics. Off-hand comments about
        world news and politics as they pertain to programming
        are allowed, but fundamentally this is a programming
        forum; This isn't the place for full-on political discussion.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Only contribute to articles with positive quality changes.
        You may not delete articles without a good reason and you
        may not "deface" articles, by filling them with false
        information or anything else that doesn't pertain to the
        given topic of the article.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Have fun! Although we have to lay down some ground rules
        as to how we want the forums to be run, this is a community-run
        website. Make sure whatever you're doing, you're enjoying yourself.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>
    Failing to uphold these guidelines can &mdash; depending on the severity
    of your transgression &mdash; lead to your TrustScore dropping or your account
    being completely deleted. Any user who gains enough trust can create an article.
    If you create an article, you become the moderator of that article and its
    corresponding forum.
