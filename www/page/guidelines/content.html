    <li>
        Be nice. Treat other users the way you would expect to be treated.

        you would wish to be given.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Do not promote any sexist, racist, homophobic or otherwise
        potentially offensive content.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Do not discuss world politics. Off-hand comments about
        world news and politics as they pertain to programming
        are allowed, but fundamentally this is a programming
        forum; This isn't the place for full-on political discussion.

    <li>
        Only contribute to articles with positive quality changes.
        You may not delete articles without a good reason and you
